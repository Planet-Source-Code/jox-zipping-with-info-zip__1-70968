' This is the original example with some small changes. Only
' use with the original Zip32.dll (Zip 2.3).  Do not use this VB
' example with Zip32z64.dll (Zip 3.0).
'
' 4/29/2004 Ed Gordon

'---------------------------------------------------------------
' Usage notes:
'
' This code uses Zip32.dll.  You DO NOT need to register the
' DLL to use it.  You also DO NOT need to reference it in your
' VB project.  You DO have to copy the DLL to your SYSTEM
' directory, your VB project directory, or place it in a directory
' on your command PATH.
'
' A bug has been found in the Zip32.dll when called from VB.  If
' you try to pass any values other than NULL in the ZPOPT strings
' Date, szRootDir, or szTempDir they get converted from the
' VB internal wide character format to temporary byte strings by
' the calling interface as they are supposed to.  However when
' ZpSetOptions returns the passed strings are deallocated unless the
' VB debugger prevents it by a break between ZpSetOptions and
' ZpArchive.  When Zip32.dll uses these pointers later it
' can result in unpredictable behavior.  A kluge is available
' for Zip32.dll, just replacing api.c in Zip 2.3, but better to just
' use the new Zip32z64.dll where these bugs are fixed.  However,
' the kluge has been added to Zip 2.31.  To determine the version
' of the dll you have right click on it, select the Version tab,
' and verify the Product Version is at least 2.31.
'
' Another bug is where -R is used with some other options and can
' crash the dll.  This is a bug in how zip processes the command
' line and should be mostly fixed in Zip 2.31.  If you run into
' problems try using -r instead for recursion.  The bug is fixed
' in Zip 3.0 but note that Zip 3.0 creates dll zip32z64.dll and
' it is not compatible with older VB including this example.  See
' the new VB example code included with Zip 3.0 for calling
' interface changes.
'
' Note that Zip32 is probably not thread safe.  It may be made
' thread safe in a later version, but for now only one thread in
' one program should use the DLL at a time.  Unlike Zip, UnZip is
' probably thread safe, but an exception to this has been
' found.  See the UnZip documentation for the latest on this.

' All code in this VB project is provided under the Info-Zip license.
